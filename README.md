#Hi, I'm Ricky 👋

I’m a **Data Science** graduate on a mission to turn raw data into actionable insights. With a deep passion for statistics, machine learning, and data visualization, I thrive on solving complex problems and unveiling patterns that lead to smarter decisions. My work focuses on the intersection of **analytics and sports**, where I aim to combine technical expertise with my love for the game to create innovative solutions in the sports industry.

When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me exploring new trends in technology, optimizing workflows, or diving deep into sports analytics.

###🌟 Fun Fact:
"Man does the work he doesn't want. But in the end, the work defines him."
